# TwitterPicParser

This is a joke project that I did over summer 2021 because I was bored and lazy.

I retweet a lot of art on twitter, but I dislike how tedious it is to download art.
I was lazy, so I spent more time making this program then it would've to download all of the images I ever retweeted.

Some stuff you need:


Python packages:

Selenium (install using pip)

requests (also using pip)


Other stuff:

chromedriver (this has to match the version of your chrome brower.)
